# HARDWARE DESIGN GOALS
###

*   A common, compact form factor will be used--if possible, form factor
    compatible with Arduino or Raspberry Pi 2.
*   Pin header compatibility with Arduino or Raspberry Pi.
*   A balance between component minimization and functional maximization shall
    be employed.
*   PCB Shall be one or two sided, with no internal layers, using either solely
    surface mount components (where applicable) or a combination of surface
    mount and through-hole components.
*   PCB Shall be designed with EMC compatibility in mind.
*   PCB Shall be designed to minimize noise introduced into high-speed digital
    systems.
*   Hardware shall be extensible, such that it will be possible to design add-on
    boards which implement useful functionalities, i.e. an interface may be
    broken out into a pin header onto which a mezzanine or extraneous board may
    be attached, etc.
*   Hardware shall be designed such that the functionality of the board is not
    limited by its interfaces (i.e. as many interfaces as possible will be
    supported).
*   Hardware jumpers shall implement some of the configurable functionalities
    of the board.
*   Hardware will be designed to minimize cost and design burdens.
*   Hardware design will be available under a common open source license
    (undetermined).
*   An ISP (in-system programmer) will be included on board.

# SOFTWARE DESIGN GOALS
###

*   Software drivers will be available for all devices on the board including
    (but not limited to) devices internal to the microcontroller device,
    extraneous devices which exist on the board, and extraneous devices which
    may be connected via the pin header.
*   Software will be primarily composed in the C programming language and
    Assembly, but other languages may be used as necessary.
*   Software will be available under a common open source license
    (undetermined).
*   Device drivers will export a simple interface, while exposing all major
    functionality of the device.
*   All software will be well documented, either in the form of text files or
    LaTeX documents. Software will not be released until all functionality of
    the software has been documented.
*   All software will follow a common style convention.
*   All device drivers will be compatible with the ABI used by the Linux kernel
    stable release currently in use at the time of design.
*   All software, including but not limited to device drivers, except where
    not applicable, must be reentrant.
*   Software will be designed to minimize damage to the hardware components in
    the event of incorrect use.
*   Software will be designed to minimize fatal software errors and application
    crashing in the event of incorrect use.

# DESIGN TIMELINE
###

*   A functioning hardware prototype shall be implemented by April 25, 2018, or
    the end of the Spring Academic Semester at Michigan Technological
    University, whichever comes first.
